Everything from favorites like Freecell and Klondike through to the hopelessly pointless Clock Patience\nMahjongg: A tile-based solitaire game with an oriental flavor. Remove tiles in matching pairs to dismantle elaborately designed stacks.\nMines: The popular logic puzzle minesweeper. Find mines on a grid using hints from squares you have already cleared.\nNibbles: Pilot a worm around a maze trying to collect diamonds and at the same time avoiding the walls and yourself. With each diamond your worm grows longer and navigation becomes more and more difficult. Playable by up to four people.\nFive or more: Move balls around the grid and try and form lines. Once you form five in a row, the line disappears. Unfortunately more balls keep dropping in.\nRobots: The classic game where you have to avoid a hoard of robots who are trying to kill you. Each step you take brings them closer toward you. Fortunately they aren't very smart and you also have a helpful teleportation gadget.\nGnometris: The Russian game of falling geometric shapes. Need I say more ?\nTali: Sort of poker with dice and less money. An ancient Roman game, this variant is similar to Yahtzee \u00ae.\nIagno: The GNOME version of Reversi. The goal is to control the most disks on the board.\nTetravex: A puzzle game where you have to match a grid of tiles together. The skill level ranges from the simple two by two up to the seriously mind-bending six by six grid.\nKlotski: A series of sliding block puzzles. Try and solve them in the least number of moves."}},"icon":"http://repo.openpandora.org/files/pnd/gnomeGames-13425/icon.png","uri":"http://repo.openpandora.org/includes/download.php?app=gnomeGames-13425","md5":"4739493cdcf1803761f7b97fb8557108","vendor":"sebt3","applications":[{"id":"gnomegames-lightsoff-27566","version":{"major":"2","minor":"31","release":"6","build":"1","type":"release"},"author":{"name":"sebt3","website":"http://sebt3.openpandora.org/pnd/"},"localizations":{"en_US":{"title":"Lights
